This is a sophisticated phishing platform designed to mimic a legitimate ecommerce website selling Steam game codes. The backend, built with Express.js, captures purchase data and uses a Telegram bot to distribute the stolen information. The frontend, crafted to resemble a genuine online store, features security images, a countdown timer for discounts, and input validation to enhance authenticity. Upon purchase, customers receive a confirmation email with a fake Steam key, generated using Mailjet, to delay their realization of the scam. This project explores the integration of new technologies and strategic promotion within the gaming community to effectively execute phishing attacks.
